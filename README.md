  - ⁤Code Companion would be a practical toolkit for developers, offering a mobile collection of coding tools. ⁤⁤It would include a REPL for portable testing, as well as helpful developer tools such as syntax checkers and formatters. ⁤⁤The app would also be able to provide a runtime analysis with visual aids like graphs to help track memory usage and code efficiency. ⁤⁤The goal of Code Companion is to aid in debugging, testing, and improving code in real-time. ⁤
